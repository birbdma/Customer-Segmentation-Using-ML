▪ Apply ML models to segment market based on customer's specific needs to launch targeted marketing campaigns
▪ Performed EDA on 9k credit card holders’ data with 18 variables like amount, tenure to understand customer behavior 
▪ Employed scikit-learn library and elbow method to obtain optimal number of clusters for segmenting the market as 4 
▪ Deployed K-means algorithm to group customers with similar needs together & applied PCA to make it more efficient
▪ Generated 4 customer segments: transactors, revolvers, low tenure & VIPs to launch targeted ad marketing campaigns
