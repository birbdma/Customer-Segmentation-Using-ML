# Unsupervised-ML-for-Customer-Market-Segmentation
Coursera Guided Project May’21 - July’21
Objective:
Apply Machine Learning models for market segmentation based on customer's needs to launch marketing campaigns
Approach:		
Performed EDA on 9k credit card holders' data with 18 variables (amount, tenure, etc.) to interpret customer behavior
Employed scikit-learn library and elbow method to obtain optimal number of clusters for segmenting the market as 4
Deployed K-Means algorithm to group customers with similar needs together & applied PCA to make it more efficient
Result:		
Generated 4 customer segments: transactors, revolvers, low tenure & VIPs; marketing ad campaigns to be launched
Devised clusters based on factors like % of full payment (transactors: 23%, revolvers: 3%), balance, credit limit, tenure
Compiled & fitted unsupervised ML techniques such as PCA to perform dimensionality reduction & data visualization
